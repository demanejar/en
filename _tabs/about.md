### Hello, We are ***De Manejar Team***

Demanejar is a blog about bigdata and things surrounding bigdata. Big data is one of the important branches of Computer Science in recent years as the data generated every day is gradually increasing exponentially, and the processing of this data to produce new data is increasing exponentially. Useful, exploitable data is a need of any large company or corporation. Data is considered gold in the digital age because companies and corporations that hold a lot of data will have a much greater advantage over other companies. Only with data can AI work, and the larger the data, the more accurately AI algorithms will operate.

Big data will be a trend in the coming years, however, there are not enough Vietnamese blogs about Bigdata and not enough depth, so our group decided to write this blog together to share with everyone the knowledge that we have learned. I know to contribute to enriching Vietnamese IT resources.
